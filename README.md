# MusicianFX

This AddOn is a plugin for `Musician` and `Musician: Extended` and replaces the music files defined by both addons with higher quality ones.
Credit to the original authors of both Addons, which served as inspiration to build this unique, small extension.

Currently the following instruments are enhanced:

* Clarinet
* Harp
* Lute
* Piano
* Recorder
