# MusicianFX

This AddOn is a plugin for `Musician` and `Musician: Extended` and adds new, enhanced music files for specific instruments.


## The following instruments are added and mapped:

* Clarinet FX (**TenorSax : 66**)
* Distortion Guitar FX (**DistortionGuitar : 30**)
* Guitar FX (**AcousticGuitarSteel : 25**)
* Harp FX (**TremoloStrings : 44**)
* Lute FX (**PizzicatoStrings : 45**)
* Piano Roland FX (**BrightAcousticPiano : 1**)
* Piano Yamaha FX (**ElectricGrandPiano  : 2**)
* Recorder FX (**Whistle : 78**)
* Violin FX (**Violin : 40**)

Similar to `MusicianExtended`, adding the new sounds might increase loading times
and memory usage. 
Also, if you had previously mapped songs, you will need to remap them with the
new instruments.
